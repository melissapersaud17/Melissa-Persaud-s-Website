  <p class="article1"> The Reality of Gender in the Workplace </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class="article1description">
    Women are faced with personal, social and economic problems. But they’re also faced with issues in
    the workplace and no one seems to acknowledge it.</p>

  <p class="article1description2"> Looking back into history, it was originally women who created the field of computer science during WWII.
    According to The Atlantic, they were asked to come in and solve complex problems to improve the accuracy
    of weapons. During the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s women were rising in computer programming. Fortune magazine
    reports that during the 1980s the percentage of female computer science majors declined from 37% to 18%.
    The reasons for these dwindling numbers varies on numerous aspects. Some sources said men practically came
    in and took credit for the women’s work. Others have said computers and anything pertaining to technology
    were directed towards young boys and men during the time.</p>

  <p class="article1description3">  The tech industry involves various levels of expertise, ranging from software engineers, web developers,
    security analyst. But it is very clear that, this field is primarily male dominated.</p>

  <p class="article1description4">  Over the years, the gender gap within the tech field has widened significantly. Some women who are in this
    industry, have experienced a variety of issues with men. Women encountered rude comments, sexual harassment,
    alienation and isolation from their male employees and much more.</p>

  <p class="article1description5">  There are some men who use their power to their own advantage over women. Journalist Queenie Wong at The
    Mercury News, reports women in Silicon Valley, California, face high rates of discrimination. Women recently
    have spoken out about their sexual harassment. As she states, “The upheaval in tech has mirrored the disruption
    in Hollywood, the news media and on Capitol Hill as people have shared their accounts of being sexually harassed.”</p>

  <p class="article1description6">  There are men who have no idea or unaware of what transpires in the work environment. To address this issue, a
    survey known as “The Elephant in the Valley” has been created to raise awareness for women. This is a platform used
    by women to share their stories and experiences they have encountered with men in Silicon Valley. Looking at the
    data and the statistics it provides, it is really tragic to see how many women have kept quiet all these years.</p>

  <p class="article1description7">  Reports came back from 200+ women, in a range of 10+ years of experience. More than half of the women felt like
    they were excluded from networking opportunities because of their gender. Nearly 90% experienced incidents when
    questions, comments or concerns were directed towards their male colleagues, when it was more appropriately addressed
    to them.  About 60% of women have experienced unwanted sexual signals from men in their workplace. The reports proceed
    to tell about the unjust events taking place in the tech industry.</p>

  <p class="article1description8">  So, did America really make progress in terms of equality for women (casting aside the idea of voting rights) or are
    we living the same way we did back in the 1800 and 1900s?</p>
