  <p class="mybio" > Hello and welcome to my website!</p>

  <p class="mybio2"> My name is Melissa and I am currently a sophomore attending
  Queensborough Community College in New York. I am pursing a
  degree in Computer Science, more specifically a career in
  web development.</p>

  <p class="mybio3"> My love for designing and creating new things started when I
  was young. But I never gave it much thought , until I got older.
  During my senior year of high school I became fascinated with web
  page design, computer graphics, photography and all things art.
  Now here I am showcasing the things I love to do!</p>

  <p class="mybio4" > For those who have a little time on their hands, I am happy to
  share with you all of my projects, artwork and blog! If you need
  to get into contact with me, please feel free to reach out! All
  the information is listed in the contacts page! I hope you enjoy
  and thank you for your time!</p>
